    "description": "I projected a concept idea that resulted in a 40% maintenance cost reduction by using Digital Twins to automate retail chain stages. I collaborated with a team, which included mentors from Accenture and fellow students, to manage the task of improving post-pandemic user experience by implementing Accenture technology. Through task splitting, creating a Gantt chart plan, and quantifying workload, we completed the task three days ahead of the deadline and won third prize in the competition.",
